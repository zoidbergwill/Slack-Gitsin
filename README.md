The Problem
=================

> *We have Slack we use in our office using the Windows stand alone since the Chrome based app seems to not show notifications in the bar (highlighting the app when you have a waiting message).*
> *Nearly every day Slack has to be manually closed via task manager (all users at random times) because Slack is taking up nearly all CPU and memory on the PCs.*
> *Is this a known issue and if so is there any solution?*
